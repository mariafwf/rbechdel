# Bechdel Test: An Analysis in R

The Bechdel Test is one of the most popular ways of measuring gender bias in movies. Its main idea comes from a 1985 strip by cartoonist Alison Bechdel. As part of her “Dykes To Watch Out” series, Bechdel wrote that a movie will only pass what she calls “The Rule” if it includes at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man. movies.csv is the main dataset used for this analysis and includes general information about movies from 1970 to 2013, as well as whether or not they pass the Bechdel Test. The dataset was extracted from the Tidy Tuesday project.
